    "This project focuses on applying reinforcement learning techniques to develop an automated stock trading system. By leveraging technical indicators and a defined reward function, the project aims to train an intelligent agent capable of making informed decisions on buying, selling, or holding stocks. The project involves preprocessing stock data, defining the trading environment, training the reinforcement learning agent using algorithms like Deep Q-Network, and evaluating its performance on separate datasets. Through this project, the goal is to create a robust model that can adapt to changing market conditions and optimize trading strategies for potential profit.\n",

The observation space is continuous, consisting of the stock's closing price and the values of various technical indicators at the current time step. \n",
    "    - In the  code, `self.action_space = gym.spaces.MultiDiscrete([3, 10])` defines the action space for the StockTradingEnv environment. `gym.spaces.MultiDiscrete` is a class from the OpenAI Gym library that is used to define a multidimensional discrete action space. It accepts a list of integers, where each integer specifies the number of possible values for a particular dimension. In this case, [3, 10] is passed to the MultiDiscrete class, creating a 2D action space with the following properties: The first dimension has 3 possible values (0, 1, 2), which represent different action types: buy (0), sell (1), or hold (2). The second dimension has 10 possible values (0, 1, 2, ..., 9), representing the number of shares to trade during the buy or sell action.\n",

    "3. **Step** : The `step` method takes in an action and updates the environment state accordingly. If the action is to buy, the environment calculates the number of shares that can be bought with the available cash, deducts the purchase price from the cash balance, and adds the purchased shares to the shares held variable. If the action is to sell, the environment sells the specified number of shares, adds the sale price to the cash balance, and calculates the profits made based on the difference between the purchase and sale prices. The method returns the updated observation, profits, done flag, and an empty dictionary.\n",

The network consists of two hidden layers with 64 neurons each and ReLU activation functions. The output layer has a linear activation function, and the number of output neurons is equal to the size of the action space.

    "4. **Act**: The `act` method selects an action based on the agent's current state. With probability epsilon, the agent selects a random action, and with probability 1 - epsilon, the agent selects the action with the highest Q-value predicted by the neural network. The agent's epsilon value decays over time to balance exploration and exploitation.\n",

    " ### 💡 Some tips to increase the performance. \n",
    " Here are a few modifications you can make to improve the performance of your model: \n",
    "- Normalize the input data: Scaling the input features can help your neural network to learn more effectively. Add a function in your `StockTradingEnv` class to normalize the input data, and apply it to your observation data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n",
    "\n",
    "class StockTradingEnv(gym.Env):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    def _normalize_data(self, data):\n",
    "        scaler = MinMaxScaler()\n",
    "        return scaler.fit_transform(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def _get_obs(self):\n",
    "        # Calculate the observation vector for the current step\n",
    "        obs = np.array([\n",
    "            # ...\n",
    "        ])\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Normalize the observation vector\n",
    "        obs = self._normalize_data(obs)\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Return the observation vector\n",
    "        return obs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "- Add more layers or increase the number of neurons in the neural network: A more complex model can potentially capture more intricate patterns in the data. However, keep in mind that increasing the complexity of the model might also increase the risk of overfitting. Modify the `_build_model` method in your `DQNAgent` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def _build_model(self):\n",
    "    # Build the neural network model\n",
    "    model = Sequential()\n",
    "    model.add(Dense(128, input_dim=self.state_size, activation='relu'))\n",
    "    model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))\n",
    "    model.add(Dense(256, activation='relu'))\n",
    "    model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu'))\n",
    "    model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))\n",
    "    model.add(Dense(self.action_size, activation='linear'))\n",
    "    model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=Adam(lr=self.learning_rate))\n",
    "    return model\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "- Increase the memory size: A larger memory size can potentially help your agent remember more experiences and learn from them. Update the memory size in your `DQNAgent` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class DQNAgent:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, state_size, action_space):\n",
    "        # ...\n",
    "        self.memory = deque(maxlen=5000)\n",
    "        # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "- Adjust hyperparameters: Experiment with different values for `gamma`, `epsilon_decay`, and `learning_rate` in your `DQNAgent` class. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for these hyperparameters, and you may need to try different combinations to find the best values for your specific problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that even with these modifications, it's important to test and validate the model on different datasets and time periods to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data. Also, note that the stock market is inherently unpredictable, and even a well-trained model may not always produce profitable results.\n"
